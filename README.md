# Three-weeek  
On the third week of ParrotaiIPT 2018, In this week I have learned a lot of concepts of recommendation system but I based on theoretical only, I have found that theory is a basis of practical for the success of the state property first to know theory then to cope with the practical.
The key concepts that I have achieved through the recommendation system as:  
- General concept of Recommendation System through books and video.  
There a lot advantage of recommendation system such as  
  - Companies using recommender systems focus on increasing sales as a result of very personalized offers and an enhanced customer experience.  
  - Recommendations typically speed up searches and make it easier for users to access content they’re interested in, and surprise them with offers they would have never searched for. 
  - What is more, companies are able to gain and retain customers by sending out emails with links to new offers that meet the recipients’ interests, or suggestions of films and TV shows that suit their profiles.
  - The user starts to feel known and understood and is more likely to buy additional products or consume more content. By knowing what a user wants, the company gains competitive advantage and the threat of losing a customer to a competitor decreases.  
  - Providing that added value to users by including recommendations in systems and products is appealing. Furthermore, it allows companies to position ahead of their competitors and eventually increase their earnings.  
Also I have learned the types of recommender systems such as  
  - Content based, which depend on characteristic information’s.
  - Collaborative filtering, which depend on user interactions.  

Also I have learned the challenges of the recommendation system there are two main challenges that come up with these systems:  
  - Cold start: we should have enough information (user-item interactions) for the system to work. 
  - Adding new users/items to the system: whether it is a new user or item, we have no prior information about them since they don’t have existing interactions.  
Lastly, through your video teaching I have learned a lot of things in a implementation practical such as:  
  - To understand your problem.  
  - To understand your data etc. 
  
Then your style for separating folder I have learned that it's easy to find out where I’m mistaken and easily solved.  
But I beg you to endure because some of us are hardly aware of something we take too much time to understand, also for the rest of the weeks i will plan to deal in deep of the practicle.    

Big up sir, keep opening our eyes and cleanse our minds in the digital world.
